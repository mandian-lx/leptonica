%description
Well-tested C code for some basic image processing operations, along with
a description of the functions and some design methods. A full set of affine
transformations (translation, shear, rotation, scaling) on images of all depths
is included, with the exception that some of the scaling methods do not work
at all depths. There are also implementations of binary morphology, grayscale
morphology, convolution and rank order filters, and applications such as jbig2
image processing and color quantization.
